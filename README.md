# 👋 Hi, I’m Mustakim  

Aspiring **Data Scientist / ML Engineer** with a background in engineering and hands-on projects in **machine learning, data pipelines, dashboards, and software engineering**.  

I focus on building **end-to-end workflows**: data ingestion → cleaning → modelling → BI/visualisation → reporting. My repos are structured and documented so that recruiters, engineers, and collaborators can follow my process clearly.
