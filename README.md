# 👋 Hi, I’m Mustakim  

Aspiring **Data Scientist / ML Engineer** with a background in engineering and hands-on projects in **machine learning, data pipelines, dashboards, and software engineering**.  

I focus on building **end-to-end workflows**: data ingestion → cleaning → modelling → BI/visualisation → reporting. My repos are structured and documented so that recruiters, engineers, and collaborators can follow my process clearly.

## 🚀 Featured Projects  

### 🕹 Twitch Streaming Analytics  
A full **ETL pipeline** for Twitch data:
- Extracts streams + games via the Twitch API  
- Cleans, transforms, and enriches with features (time of day, weekday, game join)  
- Loads into SQLite for querying and visualisation  
- Includes **sanity checks** + BI-ready CSV outputs  

**Tech**: Python, Pandas, SQL, Airflow (for orchestration)
